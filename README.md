# About ZuSE KI-mobil

The goal of ZuSE-KI-mobil is the development of a platform for the usage of „Artificial Intelligence“ in industrial and mobility applications.

In the context of this funding project 8 German partners from the industry and research as well as associated partners work on an AI accelerator and a system platform that can run complex AI algorithms in a scalable and safe manner by leveraging innovative computation architectures developed in the project. Furthermore, new concept for safety and redundancy will be explored and tested.

Demonstrators from the areas of automotive, industry and drones will show the potential of the concepts and push the development of the platform ecosystem forward

The project is funded and supported by the German Federal Ministry of Research, Technology and Space (BMFTR) in the context of the ZuSE program.

More information about the project details and partners can be found on ZuSE KI-mobil website: link coming soon.
